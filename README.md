# Social Media Feed (Java Project)

## Introduction
This project is a simple text-based social media feed implemented in Java using hash tables and linked lists. Users can create accounts, add posts, like and comment on posts, and view all feeds.

## Features
- **User Management:** Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their posts.
- **Post System:** Users can add, delete, and view their posts.
- **Like System:** Users can like or remove their like from posts.
- **Comment System:** Users can comment on posts and delete their own comments.
- **Feed Display:** Users can view their own posts and all users' posts.

## Data Structures Used
- **Hash Table:** Used to store users efficiently.
- **Linked List:** Used to manage posts and comments.
- **Dynamic Resizing:** The hash table resizes when 70% full to maintain efficiency.

## Classes Overview
### `Comment`
Represents a comment on a post.
- `text`: The comment text.
- `userId`: The user who posted the comment.
- `next`: Pointer to the next comment.

### `Post`
Represents a social media post.
- `caption`: The post content.
- `likes`: Count of likes.
- `likedBy`: Array tracking user IDs who liked the post.
- `commentHead`: Pointer to the first comment.
- `next`: Pointer to the next post.

### `User`
Represents a user account.
- `userId`: Unique ID.
- `password`: User password.
- `postHead`: Head of the linked list of posts.

### `UserNode`
Node structure for hash table chaining.
- `user`: The user data.
- `next`: Pointer to the next node in case of collision.

### `UserHashTable`
Stores and manages users.
- `table`: Array of user nodes.
- `addUser(int userId, String password)`: Adds a new user.
- `getUser(int userId)`: Retrieves a user by ID.
- `displayAllFeeds()`: Displays all posts and comments.
- **Resizing Logic:** Doubles size if more than 70% full.

### User Menu Options
- `1. Add Post` - Create a new post.
- `2. Like or Comment` - Like, comment, delete comment, or remove like.
- `3. View Feed` - View your posts.
- `4. View All Feeds` - View all users' posts and interactions.
- `5. Delete Post` - Remove one of your posts.
- `6. Logout` - Log out of the system.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.
- Allow **password encryption** for better security.
- Improve **data persistence** with file storage or a database.
- Optimize memory usage in `likedBy` array.

## Conclusion
This project is a great introduction to implementing hash tables, linked lists, and user interactions in Java. It provides a basic but functional social media feed system that can be expanded and optimized further.
